# Mayo-Workbench

Small CRUD application to inspect, modify, sort, reason and swear about data
stored in [OlegDB.](https://olegdb.org/)

## Installation

No dependencies! Sweet!

```
make
```

Theres no `make install`. Deal with it. Just run the binary from wherever you
built it, damn it.

## Usage

```
./mayoworkbench -n <dbname> [-h db-hostname/IP] [-p db-port]
```

You'll need to specify the name of the database you want to connect to. Once
it's running, you can point your web-browser at `http://localhost:8666/` to get
started.

It's pretty minimal right now, so do whatever.
